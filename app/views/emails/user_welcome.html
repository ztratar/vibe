	Hey {{ name }},
</p>
<p>
	Congrats on getting set up! Here are some suggestions on how to get started:
</p>
<h3>Get the app!</h3>
<p>
	<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.vibeapp.vibe"><strong>Download for Android</strong></a>, 
	<a href="http://www.testflightapp.com/install/c89434e98f4da18192bdf8b48d535d55-MTIyMjI1NzY/"><strong>Download for iPhone</strong></a>, 
	<a href="https://www.getvibe.com/"><strong>Go to the web version</strong></a>
</p>
<h3>Suggest new product ideas</h3>
<p>
	Have a feature running around your head? Anonymity allows ideas to stand on their own without discrimination.
</p>
<h3>Ask for overall feedback</h3>
<p>
	Did a project just ship? Ask everyone how they thought it went. Honest information is the best way to learn.
</p>
<h3>Give feedback</h3>
<p>
	When ego is removed, celebrating wins becomes that much more special. Congratulate others for a job well done or point out learning opportunities.
</p>
<p>
	If you ever have product suggestions, email them to zach@getvibe.com. I'll respond!
</p>
<p>
Thanks,<br />
The Vibe Team
