	Hey {{ name }},
</p>
<p>
	Congrats on getting set up so quickly! We want you to discover a new level of safety and freedom while using Vibe. Here are some suggestions on how to get started, but feel free to chart your own course.
</p>
<h3>Suggest new product ideas</h3>
<p>
	Have a feature running around your head? Anonymity allows ideas to stand on their own without discrimination.
</p>
<h3>Ask for overall feedback</h3>
<p>
	Did a project just ship? Ask everyone how they thought it went. Honest information is the best way to learn.
</p>
<h3>Give feedback</h3>
<p>
	When ego is removed, celebrating wins becomes that much more special. Congratulate others for a job well done or point out learning opportunities.
</p>
<p>
	If you ever have product suggestions, email them to zach@getvibe.com. I'll respond!
</p>
<p>
Thanks,<br />
The Vibe Team
